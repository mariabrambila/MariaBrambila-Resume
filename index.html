        <div class="subheading mb-5">Undeclared StudentðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Maria Brambila and I am currently a first year student at the University of California Riverside. As of now, I am undeclared in the CHASS department, however, I have a few interests that I am considering further pursuing in college. Those interests include being a physical therapist, working in the field of medicine, or in the education sector. I am thinking about majoring in biology or anatomy and a minor in education. Once I graduate college, I want to take a gap year and apply for an internship offered by a non-profit organization named Outward Bound. Outward Boundâ€™s mission is to provide underrepresented minorities with the opportunity to explore the outdoors without having to worry about the financial cost. Outward Bound makes this possible by providing a select number of underrepresented students with the Pinnacle Scholarship which I was fortunate to receive. Last summer, I went backpacking in the High Sierras for two weeks with eleven other people. Through this experience, I was able to further extend a passion of mine; I really enjoyed this experience which is why I would like to be a longtime member of Outward Bound. Once I apply for the internship with Outward Bound, my plan is to successfully complete the internship and then slowly climb up the ladder until I am an instructor and if possible a director for the Pinnacle Scholarship. Since I am unclear about what the future hold and whether I will go through with this plan, I have a backup plan. <br><br>

        My back-up plan is to graduate college and then apply for a professional program in physical therapy. Upon completion, I would like to work for a private company and travel to different states to provide my services. Previously, I mentioned I would like to minor in education; the reason for this is because I believe that it would give me a leg up when it comes to applying for Outward Boundâ€™s internship opportunity or other similar programs. If I change my mind and decide I do not want to work with organizations that focus on outdoor education, then I would like to either work in a school setting or hospital. In the hospital setting, I would like to work in the physical therapy department or work with doctors  <br><br>

        As mentioned above, I am not entirely sure what it is I want to major in; I have an idea, but I do not want to limit myself. Also, it is pretty scary to choose a career that you will work in for the rest of your life; it is a big decision to make. As the year progresses, I will investigate possible career options along with the length it takes to become a professional in the sector. For now, I will take classes that meet the general education requirements and see where life takes me. I hope you were intrigued by my story relating to my possible future school plans; please let me know if you have any helpful words of wisdom.
